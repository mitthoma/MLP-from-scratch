# MLP-from-scratch

The implementation of a multilayer perceptron neural network from scratch on the famous 'iris' dataset.  In this model, I present a three layer neural network with a relu activation function for the hidden layer and a softmax activation function for the output layer.

For this project I used Google's cloud IDE Colaboratory to develop in.  I am a fan of this environment as it allows me to run machine learning projects with hefty operations on cloud-based GPU's.  I don't have to exhaust my local system as a result of continuously testing machine learning projects!  That also means I don't have to rush for that empty seat by the wall socket outlet at Starbucks ;-)
